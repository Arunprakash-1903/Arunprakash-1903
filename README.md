# 🧠 Arun Prakash — Computer Vision Engineer  

### 👋 Hi there!  

I’m a **Computer Vision Engineer** who loves teaching machines to see.  
Currently, I work at **Dhvani Analytical Intelligence**, where I design and deploy deep learning models that make sense of complex image data — from **X-ray weld inspection** to **real-time video analytics**.  

---

## 🔬 What I Do  

- 🧩 **Object Detection & Segmentation** — trained and fine-tuned **YOLOv5/v11** models for weld defect detection  
- ⚙️ **Image Enhancement with GANs** — built **Pix2Pix** and **StyleGAN2-ADA** models for low-exposure image enhancement and synthetic data generation  
- 🚀 **Optimized Deployment** — integrated **ONNX Runtime**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** for high-performance inference  
- 📹 **Real-Time Tracking** — implemented license-plate tracking using **YOLOv11 + SORT**  
- ☁️ **Scalable Systems** — deployed pipelines on **AWS EC2**, reducing latency by 40%
